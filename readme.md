     1) Mutable :
        By default the rust takes mutable as var and it hepls the processes in multithreading or Synchroniation
        so that it can be confirm that we no need to track that var 
        Thread Safe
        No Synchronzation is need so proccess can be done concurently

    (2) Stack V/S Heap Memory Allocation
